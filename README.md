Copy of this project https://github.com/corprusCheese/tic-tac-toe from scala to typescript.

This example app is using **ws** library, so if you want to use this app, you should have something that allows you to connect to socket. For example, I use in MacOs:
    
    websocat 127.0.0.1:3000

After this you should be asked about you name, and then you can chat.

Also it has commands (it should be written after your message):

- /n - you can answer to concrete user
- /u - get all users
